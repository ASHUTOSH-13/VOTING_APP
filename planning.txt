we are going to design a appilcation where voter above 18 years will vote for a given set of candidates 


functionality:
1. user signup or login
2. list of candidates that are standing in a election 
3. one person can give only one vote 
4. there should be a route that provides live counting of the votes sorted by their vote count 
5. user data must contain their one unique govt. id : aadhar card number
6. there should be one admin who will maintain the table of candidates and he cannot vote at all.
7. user can change their password.
8. user can login only via their aadhar card number as username and password.
